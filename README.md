# TechQuiz

TechQuiz is a console-based quiz program that tests users on computer science questions. There are multiple categories (including Fundamentals, C, Java, and JavaScript) and a variety of question types, including multiple choice, true-false, essay, and short answer. The program prompts users to select a category and then proceeds to generate a quiz. After users complete the quiz, they see their score as well as any missed answers, and they are asked to play again.

Citations and Pseudocode

The Main Files and Test Files include pseudocode for all major methods and pieces of functionality. Outside sources are cited in pseudocode above the appropriate code within the source files.

Note: I also included my tje55_project1 files as cited sources because I used very similar logic for parsing CSV files in both projects.
