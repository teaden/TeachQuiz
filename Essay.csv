What are some of the benefits of a linked list over an ArrayList?,"There are numerous reasons for choosing a linked list over an ArrayList. First, and perhaps most importantly, a linked list could be a better choice when we do not know how many values we need to store. If we were to use an ArrayList, which oftentimes uses an array under the hood, and the number of values reached the fixed length of the array, the ArrayList would have to create a new array that is twice as big as the old array and copy all values to the new array. Beyond the fact that numerous copy operations could be computationally expensive, the array length increases result in larger and larger sections of contiguous memory being occupied. On the other hand, linked list nodes do not have to be contiguous in memory in order for the linked list to operate effectively. Additionally, linked lists can be optimized to have more efficient insertion and deletion operations. For inserting into or removing from the middle of a linked list or the middle of an ArrayList, one must first traverse to the appropriate section in either data structure. However, inserting into or removing from the middle of an ArrayList could require reindexing all values following the insertion or deletion point. Conversely, for linked lists, after traversing to the appropriate spot for insertion or deletion, performing either operation simply requires reassigning pointers and is thus a constant-time runtime addition.",JAVA,1500
